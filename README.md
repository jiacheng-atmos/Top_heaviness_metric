The top_heaviness_metric.py is the main file. 
top_heaviness_ratio_calculation.py and top_heaviness_ratio_robustness_calc.py are the two sub-calculation file. If you only want to calculate top-heaviness ratio, you don't have to run the robustness_calc file. But if you wanna do some tests, robustness_calc.py should be included. Please feel free 
to contact.
